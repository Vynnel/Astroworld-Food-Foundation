      <h2>1. Tibs (sautéed meat chunks)</h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <div class="Image">

      </div>
      <p>The country’s “go-to meat dish,” as Curtis describes it, is usually made from beef cut into small chunks and sautéed in butter or oil with onions, garlic, hot pepper and rosemary. You’ll find this on most general Ethiopian menus, served with injera, naturally.</p>
      <h3>Its Recipe</h3>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
              <li>5 tablespoons niter kibbeh, or plain unsalted butter</li>
              <li>2 medium onions, chopped medium (about 2 cups)</li>
              <li>3 inch knob ginger, minced, about 2 tablespoons</li>
              <li>6 medium cloves garlic, minced, about 2 tablespoons</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons berbere.</li>
              <li>Kosher salt</li>
              <li>1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes, trimmed of excess fat and connective tissue</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>

      <h5>Instructions</h5>
      <div class="image"></div>
      <p>make sure that,</p>
      <p>1.Melt niter kibbeh or butter in a heavy saucepan on medium heat, then add onions, ginger, garlic, and berbere. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are dark, ruddy, and golden, about 30 minutes. Onions should be at a low sizzle during cooking process. Adjust heat accordingly. Transfer to food processor and blend until not quite a purée. Return to saucepan, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.<br>2.Season beef on all sides generously with kosher salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat high until lightly smoking. Add beef in a single layer, leaving plenty of open space in the pan (brown in batches if you don't have a large enough skillet). Cook without moving until well-seared on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip meat cubes with tongs and cook on second side until well seared. Continue to cook meat, stirring and flipping occasionally until desired level of doneness is reached. For rare meat, transfer to saucepan immediately. For medium, cook an additional one to two minutes before transferring to saucepan. For well done, cook up to five more minutes before transferring to saucepan.<br>3.Toss beef with warm sauce, stir in lemon juice, and serve immediately.</p>

      <h2>2. Shiro be Kibbe (legume stew)</h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <div class="Image">attributes</div>
      <p>This is Ethiopia’s peasant dish, although it’s eaten by all classes and is the most popular dish in the country.” In Addis, Richman and Curtis took my group to a hole-in-the-wall specializing in shiro. (It was Friday, a fasting day, so this was in lieu of visiting a butcher shop with an attached restaurant.) The reddish, saucy dish is made by combining a flour of ground split peas and chickpeas with kibbe, or spiced clarified butter. “It’s an incredibly rich and delicious dish,” Vynnel says. “This is our favorite thing to eat in Ethiopia.”</p>

      <h2>3. Kitfo (Ethiopian beef tartare)</h2>
      <h5></h5>
      <div class="Image">

      </div>
      <p>Tartare fans, this might be your favorite new Ethiopian dish. Kitfo is ground raw beef that’s been mixed with kibbe, the spiced clarified butter. It can be accompanied by mitmita, another popular Ethiopian spice blend. The result melts in your mouth and tastes great with the typical accompaniments of gomen (cooked greens) and a soft fresh cheese. A special flatbread called kocho usually accompanies the dish, along with injera.</p>
      <h3>Its Recipe</h3>
