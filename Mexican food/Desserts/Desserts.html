  <p>ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp. grated orange zest</li>
    <li>1 c. fresh orange juice</li>
    <li>½ c. unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. sugar</li>
    <li>¼ tsp. salt</li>
    <li>2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 c. sugar</li>
    <li>½ tsp. ground cinnam</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instructions</p>
  1.In a 5-quart Dutch oven, bring orange zest, orange juice, buttermilk, butter, sugar, and salt to a boil. Add flour, all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat and cool 10 minutes.
  <br> 2.Add eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated and dough is smooth and slightly elastic. Spoon dough into a 16- to 18-inch pastry bag fitted with a large star tip with a 1/2-inch opening. Line 2 large cookie sheets with waxed paper.
  Pipe dough into 3 1/2-inch-long strips onto prepared cookie sheets (you'll get about 60 strips). Place sheets in freezer 10 to 15 minutes to harden slightly; do not freeze solid.
  <br> 3.Wash out and dry Dutch oven; fill with 2 inches vegetable oil; attach a deep-fry thermometer to inside of pot. Heat oil over medium heat to 360 degrees F. Using a small spatula dipped in flour, transfer churros, 8 at a time, to hot oil and fry,
  turning with slotted spoon, until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Toss in cinnamon sugar. Fry remaining churros. Serve warm with dipping sauces
