    <h3>GRILLED SALMON RECIPE WITH MANGO SALSA</h3>
    <p>This is a simple, bright, herby grilled salmon recipe. The salmon marinade and the fresh mint mango salsa take this fish to a new level of tasty.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO GRILL SALMON PERFECTLY EVERY TIME</h3>
    <p>It goes without saying that when grilling fish, you should use a clean gas grill with generously oiled grates. Two more tips for how to grill salmon:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you grill your salmon on direct heat as we have in this recipe, you’ll want to use thicker salmon fillets with skin on. The skin holds the salmon together as it cooks over dry heat. The skin also imparts good flavor as it releases fat.</li>

      <li>Cook salmon fillets skinless side down first over high direct heat. While salmon is raw, it is firm still, and there is less chance of the flesh falling apart. Sear the skinless side first and do not disturb it or move it until some grill marks
        start to show. Salmon fillets will begin to release a bit of their fat and a thin layer (closest to the heat) will turn opaque. That’s when you have permission to carefully turn the salmon fillets over to the skin side. At this point, the skin
        does it’s work holding the fish together while finishing over lower heat.</li>

  <h4>For Salmon</h4>
  <ul>

    <li>4 salmon fillet pieces weighing about 6 ounces each, skin on</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>For Marinade</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>1/3 cup Private Reserve Greek extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>10 to 15 fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, a pinch</li>
    <h4>For Mint Mango Salsa</h4>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>2 mangoes, cubed</li>
    <li>1/2 seedless English cucumber (hot house cucumber), chopped</li>
    <li>20 fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup finely chopped red onion</li>
    <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season salmon with kosher salt on both sides and place, skinless side up, in a casserole dish deep enough to hold the marinade (I used this dish).</li>
      <li>Make the marinade. In a bowl, add extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, mint, garlic, spices, and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>Pour marinade over the salmon and let sit in room temperature for 20 minutes (or, if you have the time, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.)</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the mango salsa. In a bowl, add mangoes, cucumber, fresh mint, red onions, and lemon juice. Toss to combine. Set aside for now. (If you don’t plan to eat for a few hours, cover salsa and refrigerate until ready to use.)</li>
      <li>Heat an outdoor gas grill on high (grill is ready when you can hold your hand one inch above the grates for only 1 to 2 seconds). Spray or brush grates generously with oil (this is important so that the salmon does not stick.)</li>
      <li>Arrange salmon fillets on hot grill, skinless side down first (this way, they’ll get some nice grill marks while the fish is still firm.) Close the grill lid. Cook 1-3 minutes on the first side, depending on how thick the fillets are. DO NOT move
        the salmon fillets until you are ready to turn them over.</li>
      <li>Look for grill marks on the fish, and where the fish is closest to the grill, you should see a small layer of opaque (cooked) flesh. Using tongs and a metal spatula, carefully turn the fish over so it is now skin-side down. Now, turn heat down to
        medium. Close the grill lid. Cook for another 2-5 minutes, again depending on the thickness of the fillets. Salmon is ready when it is barely opaque throughout.</li>
      <li>Remove from the grill and serve with the mango salsa and Lebanese rice (or your favorite grain). You can serve mango salsa on top or on the side.</li>
